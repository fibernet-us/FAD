FAD is a Java program for Fiber diffraction Angular Deconvolution. It aims for measuring intensity data from partially oriented specimens to the highest possible resolution. With X-ray diffraction data placed on a polar grid, FAD performs background subtraction and disorientation deconvolution, extracts the intensity for each "reflection" on the grid, and outputs amplitude or intensity for use in structure refinement with FX-PLOR or XPLOR-NIH.
